# Fathom — tech-debt shelf

Project-local deferred work: refactors, architecture concerns, "fix later" items
spotted while editing. One row per item, append-only; check off when done, delete when
it stops mattering. Not the roadmap (planned work) or `docs/decisions/` (calls made) —
this is debt discovered mid-implementation.

**Capture trigger:** after a logical chunk, make one pass over the functions you just
edited and append anything deferred here, with enough locus to act on it cold.

**Row format:** `- [ ] path:symbol — observation (why deferred)`

## Shelf

<!-- e.g. - [ ] auth/session.py:refresh_token — re-derives the key every call (hot path); cache once the format stabilizes -->
